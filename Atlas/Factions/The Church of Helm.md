## ⚔️ **The Church of Helm in Brinechapel**

> **"Duty Above All."**

### **Deity:** Helm, The Watcher

* **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
* **Domains:** Life, Light, Order
* **Symbol:** A staring eye on a gauntlet
* **Tenets:** Vigilance, duty, protection, unflinching order

Helm's faithful believe in standing watch over civilization and guarding the innocent—whether the innocent want their help or not. In a town like **Brinechapel**, their strict adherence to law and order makes them seem oppressive, self-righteous, and disconnected from the gritty reality of port life.

## 🏛️ **Saltstone Cathedral**

* Still named after the glowing pale stone it's built from, **Saltstone Cathedral** towers above Brinechapel from the cliffs.
* Its **great bell** rings daily to remind citizens of their “duty to order.”
* Helm's **symbol—a golden gauntlet with an unblinking eye—is etched into gates, guard uniforms, and trade permits** throughout the town.
* Known as “The Watcher's Keep” among clergy.

## 🧱 **Church Structure in Town**

* The church runs **The Watchguard**—a civic law-enforcement arm. Not a military, but armed, uniformed, and feared.
* Clergy also control permits for legal trade, building repairs, and magical activities.
* The **nobility supports the church** to maintain order and keep wealth safe, even if they don’t like them personally.

## 📉 **Why the Church Fails to Control Brinechapel**

* The town’s culture is **too independent, criminal, and sea-hardened** for Helm’s strict laws to gain respect.
* The church is seen as **meddling landlubbers** by sailors, pirates, and common folk.
* Helm’s doctrine forbids compromise, so the church **refuses to negotiate** with The Maw or other guilds—making enforcement difficult.
* The Watchguard is **understaffed, underpaid, and frequently bribed or sabotaged**.

## 🧑‍⚖️ **Key NPCs**

### **Justicar Ardyn Ves**

* **Middle-aged human, female**, silver gauntlet armor, blunt and firm.
* Enforces Helm’s doctrine with zeal, but privately worries about the church’s growing irrelevance.
* Wants to **clean Brinechapel the “right” way**, without violence—but **may resort to it** if pushed.

### **Scribe-Marshal Dolric Tann**

* **Older dwarf**, keeps all records of licenses and patrols.
* Corrupt but subtle—sells info to The Maw and uses legal jargon to stall enforcement.
* Believes Helm’s ideals are noble, but impractical in Brinechapel.

---

## 🔥 **Tension Hooks**

* **The Leaky Bilge** doesn’t have a liquor license from the church… yet no one dares shut it down. The Watchguard might try.
* A **shipment of dangerous magical goods** slipped through the port without church approval—players may be tasked with retrieving it, or helping smuggle it.
* A noble is funding a **Holy Festival of Helm** to restore order, but it’s likely to become a **powder keg of rebellion**.
