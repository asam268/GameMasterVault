## ⚖️ **Brinechapel's Governing Church**

### **Church Name:** *The Sanctum of Saint Veila*

> “Order is a seawall against chaos.”

This church is **lawful neutral**, seeking to impose structure, purity, and order on what it views as a town teetering on moral collapse. It’s not evil—it believes it is a force of civilization and salvation—but its approach is **rigid, doctrinal, and unyielding**, making it deeply unpopular with common folk, especially seafarers and pirates.

---

## 🧱 **Core Tenets of the Sanctum**

* **Law is divine order** — without it, the sea (and society) swallows all.
* **Purity through discipline** — indulgence (alcohol, gambling, piracy) is spiritual decay.
* **The land must tame the sea** — metaphorically and literally.
* **Magic is acceptable, but only if regulated** — they often clash with The Star’s Lantern.

## 🛐 **Deity: Saint Veila, The Binder of Storms**

* Former mortal, now ascended saint or minor goddess.
* Said to have once calmed a storm by binding it in prayer and chain.
* Depicted as a robed figure holding an iron ring and a chain of light.
* **Domains:** Order, Knowledge, Light

> ⚠️ The locals don’t worship her, but nobles fund her temples to look virtuous.

## 🏛️ **Saltstone Cathedral (Headquarters)**

* Built from quarried pale rock that glows slightly under moonlight.
* Situated high above the docks, with imposing architecture meant to “look down on vice.”
* Its bells toll at dawn and dusk, always heard, rarely listened to.

## 🧑‍⚖️ **Key Figures**

### **High Ordainer Malrik Thew**

* Stoic, bald, with a permanent frown and polished silver chain draped across his robes.
* Believes Brinechapel is a “rotting vessel of sin” that must be sealed and repaired.
* Secretly drinks cheap grog in private—sees it as penance, not hypocrisy.

### **Sister Halwen**

* Young, devout, but doubts the church’s effectiveness.
* Sometimes helps townsfolk quietly, earning suspicion from superiors.
* Could be a valuable ally to players.

---

## 🔥 **Conflicts With Brinechapel**

* Most pirates and traders consider the Sanctum self-righteous tyrants.
* The church tries to **regulate trade**, pushing high taxes and banning “immoral goods” (liquor, dice, love potions, etc.).
* They regularly try (and fail) to **arrest The Maw**'s agents.
* Public sermons are **ignored or mocked**—though noble families show up out of obligation.

---

## 🧩 **Possible Plot Threads**

* The church is attempting to **outlaw The Leaky Bilge** for promoting vice.
* Sister Halwen asks players for help with a mission that violates church doctrine.
* The Sanctum has uncovered **a magical artifact tied to Saint Veila**, but unlocking it would require working with forbidden elements (The Star’s Lantern? The Maw?).
