## **The Leaky Bilge – Tavern Notes**

### **Overview:**

* **Type:** Dockside tavern and inn (very few rooms, mostly a local haunt)
* **Location:** Nestled between warehouses and sailmakers in the port district. Faintly smells of old wood, stale beer, and the sea.
* **Vibe:** Rowdy, low ceilings, dim lighting. Feels cramped during peak hours, cozy during off-times.
* **Clientele:** Sailors, fishers, smugglers, broke adventurers, town drunks, and the occasional lost noble “slumming it.”

---

### **Exterior:**

* Leaning slightly to one side—locals say it’s always been like that.
* A wooden sign out front carved into the shape of a cracked barrel with water pouring from it.
* A swinging door barely clinging to its hinges. A crooked window with a view of the sea (or, more accurately, of crates and seagulls).

---

### **Interior:**

* **Floor:** Sticky, always a little damp—no one knows why.
* **Lighting:** Flickering lanterns, colored glass bottle sconces.
* **Furniture:** Sturdy but mismatched; one table has a sword embedded in it (legend says it's from a duel Bart broke up by just yelling).
* **Bar Area:** Spotless—[[Ellis Spill Fenrick]]’s domain. Full of handmade signs like *“No Fighting Near the Ale”* and *“Spilled Rum is a Flogging Offense (Just Kidding. Maybe.)”*
* **Back Room:** Locked. Bart keeps records, smuggling info, and possibly some personal keepsakes inside.

---

### **Menu (simple but flavorful):**

* **Food:**

  * *Dockhand's Stew:* Thick, fish-based, and a little questionable. Comes with hardtack.
  * *Bilge Toast:* Fried bread with a rotating spread (sometimes savory, sometimes sweet).
  * *Riggston’s Remedy:* A “hangover cure” made of eggs, vinegar, and magic. Not FDA-approved.

* **Drinks:**

  * *Stormcask Ale:* The house brew, dark and slightly salty.
  * *Siren’s Rum:* Imported (maybe smuggled), very strong.
  * *Tiefling's Regret:* A joke cocktail—intentionally spicy and served flaming. Bart never touches it.

### **Notable Features & Rumors:**

* **The "Leaky" Part Is Real:** There’s a steady drip from the rafters that no one’s been able to stop. Bart claims it’s a “blessing from the sea.” Others think it’s just rot.
* **The Secret Booth:** A shadowed corner table has been carved out to be slightly soundproof. Used by those with less-than-legal intentions.
* **Ghost Rumor:** Drunken sailors say the place is haunted by a drowned crewmate of Bart’s. Sometimes glasses clink on their own.

---

### **Regular Patrons:**

* **Mags “Three-Eyes” Dourley:** An old sailor with an eyepatch... on each eye. She's blind but can still win a drinking contest.
* **Kip:** A pickpocketing street kid who barters rumors for leftovers.
* **“Uncle” Scran:** A local fisherman who insists he *was* a sea king, but “gave it all up for the haddock trade.”

---

### **Plot Hooks & Use Cases:**

* **Rumor Hub:** Ellis overhears shady conversations. Bart sometimes passes useful info to trusted adventurers—especially if it keeps trouble out of his tavern.
* **Safe House:** If the players gain Bart’s trust, he may offer a backroom as a temporary hideout.
* **Trouble Magnet:** Fights, shady deals, or smuggling exchanges can erupt here, especially if PCs start asking questions or flash gold.
* **Bart’s Past Returns:** A former crewmate (or enemy) might use the Bilge as a meeting point—or battleground.
* **Haunted Corner Table:** Maybe that ghost rumor isn’t *just* a rumor.
