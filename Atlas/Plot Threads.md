From initial church concept:
- [ ] The church is attempting to **outlaw The Leaky Bilge** for promoting vice.
* [ ] Sister Halwen asks players for help with a mission that violates church doctrine.
* [ ] The Sanctum has uncovered **a magical artifact tied to Saint Veila**, but unlocking it would require working with forbidden elements (The Star’s Lantern? The Maw?).

Helm
- [ ] **The Leaky Bilge** doesn’t have a liquor license from the church… yet no one dares shut it down. The Watchguard might try.
* [ ] A **shipment of dangerous magical goods** slipped through the port without church approval—players may be tasked with retrieving it, or helping smuggle it.
* [ ] A noble is funding a **Holy Festival of Helm** to restore order, but it’s likely to become a **powder keg of rebellion**.
