> - [[Bart Riggston]]'s Apprentice
> - Someone kind of like Spook from *Mistborn: The Final Empire*
> - Young and really looks up to Bart
> - Always cleaning things up and a really good apprentice/bar-back for Bart
> - Does have a habit of being clumsy and breaking things, especially in front of Bart
> - Since he is not taken very serious at The Leaky Bilge, he does hear a lot of rumors and secrets
> - He is a half-elf. Bart saved him when he was younger. His human mom's husband was going to kill when he was younger. Not only was the husband not the father of this child, but the child has elf blood. The husband's prejudice against elves even outweighs his wife's betrayal
> - While Bart can be hard on him sometimes, the apprentice has a permanent home at *[[The Leaky Bilge]]*

### **Name:** *Ellis “Spill” Fenrick*

> (He’s called “Spill” by regulars for... obvious reasons. He hates it, but Bart insists it’s a rite of passage.)

### **Race:** Half-Elf

### **Age:** 17

### **Occupation:** [[Bart Riggston]]’s apprentice / bar-back at *[[The Leaky Bilge]]*

---

### **Backstory:**

Ellis was born to a human woman in a poor dockside neighborhood. His elven father was long gone—possibly never knew Ellis existed. His mother’s human husband was abusive, controlling, and bitterly prejudiced against elves. When the man discovered the truth of Ellis’s heritage, he flew into a rage. Bart, stumbling across the scene during one of his rare sober errands, intervened.

Bart didn’t mean to adopt the boy, but over time, that’s what happened. He gave Ellis a bunk, a job, and eventually a nickname (“Spill,” after the third time Ellis broke a full tray of mugs in a single shift). Though Bart is hard on him, Ellis knows that no matter how many plates he drops, the Leaky Bilge is home.

### **Personality:**

* **Earnest & Eager:** He wants nothing more than to prove himself to Bart—and to the world.
* **Awkward & Quiet:** Often speaks in a soft mumble or hesitant half-sentences unless he’s talking to someone younger, smaller, or more awkward than he is.
* **Observant:** Because people ignore him, Ellis has learned to listen—and he listens *very well*.
* **Clumsy but Capable:** He’s constantly cleaning, organizing, and fixing things around the bar... often right after knocking them over.

---

### **Appearance:**

* Tall and skinny, with too-long limbs and an always-wet apron.
* Messy brown hair that he tries to slick back like Bart’s (but it never quite works).
* His eyes are a soft hazel with a faint elven shimmer.
* He has slightly pointed ears, but he keeps them covered with a ragged newsboy cap when he’s not working.
* Often has a fresh scrape or bruise from slipping, bumping into things, or dodging broken glass.

---

### **Mannerisms:**

* Says “Sorry!” before anyone even gets mad.
* Talks to himself while cleaning—half muttering, half whispering little affirmations or reminders.
* Fidgets with the rag in his apron pocket when nervous.
* Looks down or away when praised, but glows red with pride.
* Always cleans the same mug when anxious, even if it’s already spotless.

---

### **Relationship with Bart:**

* **Mentor/Protector:** Bart saved his life, and Ellis sees him as the bravest, wisest man in the world.
* **Tough Love Dynamic:** Bart rarely gives praise directly, but will fiercely defend Ellis if anyone mocks him or calls him “just a half-breed.”
* **Mutual Loyalty:** Bart trusts Ellis to close up the bar solo; Ellis would throw himself in front of a sword for Bart without hesitation.

---

### **Secrets/Plot Hooks:**

* **Gossip Goldmine:** Because no one takes him seriously, Ellis overhears a *lot*—smugglers’ routes, whispered threats, mysterious visitors. He might unknowingly be the party’s best lead in a future mystery.
* **Mysterious Father:** His elven father could return, or perhaps Ellis has latent magical or fey blood traits yet to manifest.
* **Secret Keeper:** If pressed, Ellis might know things about Bart even the players don’t—such as the real reason Bart left the sea.
* **Potential Rogue/Spy Ally:** If the players befriend Ellis and help him grow in confidence, he could become a quietly formidable scout or informant.

### **Sample Dialogue:**

> “Y-yeah, I’ll get that for you. Sorry. I mean—yes, right away! No, not that way... oh no, not again...!”
>
> “People talk a lot when they think you’re just a kid cleaning puke.”
>
> “Bart says I’m not ready to pour drinks yet, but someday I will. I’ve been practicing... on empty mugs.”
>
> “He saved my life. If he told me to swab the ceiling, I’d get a ladder and *try.*”
