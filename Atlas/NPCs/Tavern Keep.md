### **Name:** *Bartholomew “Bart” Riggston*

### **Race:** Human

### **Age:** Late 50s

### **Occupation:** Tavern Keeper of *The Leaky Bilge*

---

### **Backstory:**

Once the loyal and boisterous first mate aboard *The Salt Widow*, Bart Riggston was a man of the sea through and through. He could tie a knot in a storm, shout orders over a typhoon, and drink rum like it was rainwater. But after decades on the open ocean, Bart began experiencing mysterious bouts of seasickness that worsened with each voyage.

What no one but Bart knows (and what he will never admit unless deeply pressed) is that the "seasickness" was really withdrawal symptoms from scaling back his drinking. A quiet ultimatum from the ship's captain—"dry up or walk the plank"—forced Bart to choose land. So, he hung up his boots, bought a rundown tavern near the docks, and turned *The Leaky Bilge* into one of the rowdiest but best-managed watering holes in the port.

### **Personality:**

* **Cheerfully Salty:** Bart speaks like he's still on the deck of a ship, full of old sea metaphors and playful curses. He loves to tell wild stories of his seafaring days—half of which are definitely embellished, and the rest almost certainly false.
* **Disarming But Sharp:** He plays the fool, but he’s far more perceptive than he lets on. He keeps tabs on the goings-on in town through the gossip in his bar.
* **Superstitious:** Years at sea have made him oddly cautious. He keeps lucky charms nailed above the door, refuses to pour drinks until the sun's over the yardarm, and won't go near tieflings—he claims “they bring storms in their shadows.”
* **Dry as Salt Cod:** While mostly jovial, he has an undercurrent of melancholy and a dry, self-deprecating wit—especially if the conversation veers too close to his past or his drinking.

---

### **Appearance:**

* Weather-beaten face with a large, hooked nose and a deeply lined forehead.
* Always wears a faded naval coat with the sleeves rolled up, covered in old stains and patched with mismatched fabric.
* Wears a small brass compass on a chain around his neck—broken, but sentimental.
* Always smells faintly of sea salt, citrus, and ale-soaked wood.

---

### **Mannerisms:**

* Calls everyone “mate” or “lass/lad,” regardless of status.
* When nervous or stressed, he polishes tankards—vigorously and unnecessarily.
* Occasionally forgets he’s on land and shouts “all hands on deck!” when things get busy in the tavern.
* Flinches subtly when a tiefling walks in but tries to cover it with a “friendly” smile.

---

### **Secrets/Drama Hooks:**

* **The Real Reason He Left the Sea:** Could be uncovered by a particularly curious player or a drinking contest gone too far.
* **Tiefling Fear Origin:** As a young sailor, his ship once barely escaped a demonic storm conjured by a cult with a tiefling leader. He never got over it, and the event was quietly covered up.
* **Old Crew Ties:** Members of his former crew might drift in as plot points—maybe one’s a pirate now, or maybe the ship’s captain is now a crime boss.
* **Local Underworld:** Bart turns a blind eye to some shady dealings in exchange for peace in his tavern, but he hates it.

### **Sample Dialogue:**

> “Aye, welcome to the Bilge! If it smells like a wet boot and a fish market on fire, that just means yer in the right place!”
>
> “Y’know, I once outran a sea dragon with nothin’ but a dinghy and a prayer. Course, I was blackout drunk at the time, so details are fuzzy.”
>
> (To a tiefling, trying to act normal) “Ah... right, welcome aboard, mate. Can I get ye a drink that’s... not cursed? Er, I mean, *on the house*!”
