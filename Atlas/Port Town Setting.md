Perfect, you’ve got a strong foundation! Let’s build out your **port town setting** based on your direction.

---

## **Step 1: Naming the Port Town**

Since the town is in a bay and piracy is common, you may want a name that sounds maritime, weathered, or historically layered.

Here are a few name options with different vibes:

### **Classic & Gritty**

* **Saltmarsh Bay** – evokes classic nautical D\&D.
* **Breakwater Hollow** – suggests both protection and secrecy.
* **Daggerwake** – sleek, dangerous-sounding.

### **Flavored with Decay/Conflict**

* **Rottharbor** – decaying grandeur; pirates may have the run of it.
* **Tidewatch** – irony if the “watch” (the church) isn’t very effective.
* **Brinechapel** – hints at the religious presence and the sea.

### **Mythic/Old World Feel**

* **Velmara’s Reach** – sounds noble but could be a front for corruption.
* **Port Valemire** – romantic, with a dark edge beneath.
* **Caelport** – simple and fantasy-flavored.


> [!Done] Brinechapel

## **Step 2: Layout & Geography**

Picture a **rough crescent-shaped bay**, with the town wrapped around the curve:

* **The Docks:** Bustling with fishing boats and shady cargo haulers.
* **Cliffside Residences:** Nobles and church leaders live above the fog line.
* **The Saltstone Cathedral:** On a bluff overlooking the town; home of the ruling church.
* **The Bilge Row:** A series of taverns, inns, and brothels near the dock—*The Leaky Bilge* is a staple here.
* **The Underways:** A web of smuggler tunnels and hideouts built into the sea caves.


> [!Warning] This description sounds great, but the cathedral name might change pending a different diety


---

## **Step 3: Church Government (Main Authority)**

### **Church of the Stormkeeper**

* **Deity:** *Procan* (a chaotic-neutral sea god in 5e) — or a homebrew version.
* **Doctrine:** Worships the sea as divine judgment. Piracy is considered heresy, but also fate.
* **Structure:** Run by a **High Tidecaller** and lower clergy known as **Wavepriests**.
* **Influence:** They control the **Harbormaster’s Guild**, collect dock taxes, and issue “divine licenses” for trade.
* **Problem:** They’re seen as corrupt and out-of-touch. Most sailors treat their blessings like superstition.

➡️ **Would you like to use a standard D\&D god like *Procan*, or invent your own deity (which I can help with)?**


> [!Warning] Thoughts
> I like the problems with seeing the church as corrupt and out-of-touch, but I would to see the church as more lawful. Is there another type of church that would exert control over the town unsuccessfully? I would like to see the values of the church conflict with the town. 


---

## **Step 4: Thieves’ Guild (Underground Power)**

### **The Maw**

* **Symbol:** A stylized shark’s mouth.
* **Reach:** Controls fencing operations, protection rackets, and smuggling routes.
* **Base of Operations:** The **Gutworks**, a hidden den beneath the fish market, masked by the stench of brine and rot.
* **Personality:** Less a tight family, more a toothy coalition. Backstabbing is common.
* **Conflict:** Some younger members are trying to push into piracy, which risks open conflict with the church and nobility.


> [!Done] This seems good


---

## **Step 5: Secondary Guild (Open Slot)**

Here are some guild types you might add to balance the scene:

### **1. Cartwrights & Chandlers Guild**

* Official supplier of ships and equipment.
* Politically neutral on the surface—but secretly finances pirates to boost demand.

### **2. Guild of Navigators**

* Trains and licenses mapmakers, sailors, and pilots.
* Hoards sea charts and magical compasses.
* May be hiding a secret about “a forbidden island” or “the stormline.”

### **3. The Star’s Lantern**

* A more magical guild—diviners, augurs, and weather witches.
* Sell fortune readings, but some may spy for the church or the Maw.

➡️ **Do you prefer a practical guild (like shipwrights) or something more magical or mystical? Or should I pitch some hybrids?**


> [!Done] The Star's Lantern seems like a really good fit

## ⚔️ **The Church of Helm in Brinechapel**

> **"Duty Above All."**

### **Deity:** Helm, The Watcher

* **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
* **Domains:** Life, Light, Order
* **Symbol:** A staring eye on a gauntlet
* **Tenets:** Vigilance, duty, protection, unflinching order

Helm's faithful believe in standing watch over civilization and guarding the innocent—whether the innocent want their help or not. In a town like **Brinechapel**, their strict adherence to law and order makes them seem oppressive, self-righteous, and disconnected from the gritty reality of port life.

---

## 🏛️ **Saltstone Cathedral**

* Still named after the glowing pale stone it's built from, **Saltstone Cathedral** towers above Brinechapel from the cliffs.
* Its **great bell** rings daily to remind citizens of their “duty to order.”
* Helm's **symbol—a golden gauntlet with an unblinking eye—is etched into gates, guard uniforms, and trade permits** throughout the town.
* Known as “The Watcher's Keep” among clergy.

---

## 🧱 **Church Structure in Town**

* The church runs **The Watchguard**—a civic law-enforcement arm. Not a military, but armed, uniformed, and feared.
* Clergy also control permits for legal trade, building repairs, and magical activities.
* The **nobility supports the church** to maintain order and keep wealth safe, even if they don’t like them personally.

---

## 📉 **Why the Church Fails to Control Brinechapel**

* The town’s culture is **too independent, criminal, and sea-hardened** for Helm’s strict laws to gain respect.
* The church is seen as **meddling landlubbers** by sailors, pirates, and common folk.
* Helm’s doctrine forbids compromise, so the church **refuses to negotiate** with The Maw or other guilds—making enforcement difficult.
* The Watchguard is **understaffed, underpaid, and frequently bribed or sabotaged**.

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ **Key NPCs**

### **Justicar Ardyn Ves**

* **Middle-aged human, female**, silver gauntlet armor, blunt and firm.
* Enforces Helm’s doctrine with zeal, but privately worries about the church’s growing irrelevance.
* Wants to **clean Brinechapel the “right” way**, without violence—but **may resort to it** if pushed.

### **Scribe-Marshal Dolric Tann**

* **Older dwarf**, keeps all records of licenses and patrols.
* Corrupt but subtle—sells info to The Maw and uses legal jargon to stall enforcement.
* Believes Helm’s ideals are noble, but impractical in Brinechapel.

---

## 🔥 **Tension Hooks**

* **The Leaky Bilge** doesn’t have a liquor license from the church… yet no one dares shut it down. The Watchguard might try.
* A **shipment of dangerous magical goods** slipped through the port without church approval—players may be tasked with retrieving it, or helping smuggle it.
* A noble is funding a **Holy Festival of Helm** to restore order, but it’s likely to become a **powder keg of rebellion**.

---

Would you like help:

* Designing **quests** that involve the church?
* Creating **specific Watchguard patrol encounters**?
* Or fleshing out **how Helm’s teachings twist or adapt in Brinechapel**?

Also, should we expand **how the church and The Maw interact**, or circle back to that later?
