## **1. Establish the Port Town Setting (Macro Level)**

> 📍 *Where is The Leaky Bilge? What kind of place surrounds it?*

> [!TODO] You don’t need a full city yet, but sketching out:
> * [x] **Name of the town**
> * [x] **Basic geography** (e.g., cliffs, beaches, swamps, coral reefs?)
> * [x] **Main industries** (e.g., fishing, shipbuilding, trade, piracy?)
> * [x] **Factions** (guilds, churches, rival taverns, crime groups)

> [!Question]
> **Do you imagine this port as more gritty and grounded (like a working-class harbor), or exotic and magical (like a coral-based elven port)?**

---

## **2. Connect to Adventure Opportunities**

> 🧭 *What might bring adventurers to this town?*

Build at least 3 **potential adventure hooks**. 

> [!example] Examples:
> * A smuggling ring uses the Bilge’s basement.
> * A mysterious ship docks with no crew, just a locked box.
> * A noble’s daughter runs away and is hiding in town disguised as a tavern server.

> [!Question]
> **Would you prefer open-ended sandbox quests, or are you imagining a few bigger narrative arcs/plotlines?**

---

## **3. Expand NPC Web**

> 👥 *Who else lives in or influences this town?*

> [!TODO]
> * [ ] Friendly rivals to Bart
> * [ ] Town guard captain (competent or corrupt?)
> * [ ] A local wizard, hedge witch, or fortune teller
> * [ ] Criminal contacts, shady merchants, fishers with old sea tales

Focus on **people your players can meet in the first session or two**. These characters are great for fun RP, quest hooks, or light drama.

> [!Question]
> **Do you want these NPCs to mostly feel humorous and quirky, or a mix with serious/dramatic tones?**

---

## **4. Anchor the World with Culture & Flavor**

> 🎣 *What makes this port feel real and unique?*

You could brainstorm:

> [!Example]
> * Local slang (e.g., “splashin’ silver” = wasting money)
> * Unique festivals or rituals (e.g., throwing coins in the sea for safe travel)
> * Superstitions (e.g., “never drink with your back to the sea”)

---

## **5. Decide the Scale**

> 🗺 *Are you building just this town, or a whole region?*

> [!Example] Eventually you might want to define:
> 
> * Neighboring towns or islands
> * Sea routes or trade lines
> * Who rules the region (a lord, a council, no one?)

But for now, you can keep it focused.

> [!Question]
> **Are your players starting in this town, or just passing through it?**
> **Do you expect the campaign to stay in this area or travel widely?**
